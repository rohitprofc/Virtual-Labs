                A pronoun is a word that we use to replace a noun (a person, place, thing, or idea) so we don't have to keep saying the same noun over and over again in a sentence. <br><br>For example, instead of saying "John went to the store, and John bought a bike," <br><br>we can use pronouns and say, "John went to the store, and he bought a bike." In this case, "he" is the pronoun that replaces "John." Pronouns make sentences shorter and easier to understand
