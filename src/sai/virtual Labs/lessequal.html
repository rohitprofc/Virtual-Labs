        <h1>LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO:</h1>
        <h2>As the name suggests, less than or equal to means that a variable is either less than or equal to the other number, expression, or term. Using the terms 'at most', 'no more than', 'maximum of', and 'not exceeding' also means less than or equal to. Shown in the figure below is the symbol used to express less than or equal to. You can notice the line below the 'less than' symbol that makes it different from each other.</h2>
